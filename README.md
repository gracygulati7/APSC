# NeuroVision: Forecasting Health on the Spectrum 

This repository contains machine learning models and techniques for predicting Autism, Parkinson's Disease, Stroke, and Covid-19 infections. The project aims to leverage artificial intelligence and data science to provide insights into these medical conditions, aiding in early diagnosis and better healthcare management.

### About the Project:
The project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze relevant datasets and develop predictive models for each condition. By training on diverse datasets and employing advanced techniques, we aim to achieve accurate predictions that can assist healthcare professionals in decision-making and patient care.

### Datasets:
We have sourced publicly available datasets on Kaggle for each medical condition:

- **Autism**: The Autism Screening Adult Data includes demographic and behavioral features for individuals to predict autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
- **Parkinson's Disease**: The Parkinson's Telemonitoring Data provides voice recordings and clinical measurements for predicting the severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms.
- **Stroke**: The Stroke Prediction Dataset contains medical records and lifestyle information to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence.
- **Covid-19**: The Covid-19 Data includes epidemiological information and demographic data to predict Covid-19 infections.

### Models and Techniques:
For each medical condition, we have employed various machine learning algorithms and techniques tailored to the specific characteristics of the data:

- **Autism**:
  - Algorithm: Logistic Regression
  - Techniques: Feature engineering and cross-validation.

- **Parkinson's Disease**:
  - Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Techniques: Kernel methods and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Stroke**:
  - Algorithm: Random Forest, logistic regression, svm, decision tree, naive bayes
  - Techniques: Feature importance analysis and ensemble techniques.

- **Covid-19**:
  - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM and decision trees
  - Techniques: Data balancing using SMOTE and feature scaling for normalization.

Each model is trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques to ensure robustness and accuracy in predictions.

### Results and Evaluation:
The models have been evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed evaluation reports, confusion matrices, and visualizations are provided for each model to assess their effectiveness and reliability.

### Usage:
Users can clone the repository, preprocess the datasets, train the models using provided scripts, and make predictions on new data. Instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction are provided in the respective directories.
